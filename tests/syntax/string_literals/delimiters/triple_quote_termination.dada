# A triple-quoted string cannot contain three consecutive unescaped
# double-quote characters — the first """ always terminates the string.
# So """hello"""world""" is parsed as the string "hello" followed by
# the identifier `world` and then an unterminated string.

async fn main() {
    print("""hello"""world""").await
    #!               ^^^^^ /extra input
    #! /missing end quotes for triple-quoted string
}
